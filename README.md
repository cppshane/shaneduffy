# My Portfolio Site
So this is my personal portfolio/blog site, built with Angular/.NET/Mongo.
- Angular Universal SSR and Prerendering
- VSCode Launch Configurations for Angular/.NET Full Stack App
- Docker Prod/Dev Configurations for Angular/.NET Full Stack App

### Running it
You can run it with the VS Code configurations or the following Docker command in the API folder and the site folder:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
